\section{The BGW protocol for MPC}

\begin{prcl}
The idea behind \text{BGW} is to map boolean circuits to arithmetic circuits over a finite field $\bF_p$:
\begin{align*}
    0 &\mapsto 0 \\
    1 &\mapsto 1 \\
    \and &\mapsto \cdot \\
    a \xor b &\mapsto a + b - 2 a b
\end{align*}

\begin{prcl}
The \textbf{Shamir secret sharing} protocol is a $t$-out-of-$n$ secrete sharing protocol where
\begin{itemize}
    \item any $t$ parties can reconstruct the shared value given their shares
    \item any set of $t-1$ parties learns no information about shared value
\end{itemize}

\begin{defn}
Suppose we have secret sharings $[x], [y]$ and
we want to compute $[z]$ where $z = xy$.
Assume that parties hold secret sharings $[a], [b], [c]$,
which are called a \textbf{Beaver triple}.
