\section{Private Data Collection}

\paragraph{Secure aggregation.}
Suppose we have a large number of clients, each holding $x_i$.
The server wants to compute $\sum_i x_i$.
Assume all clients have Diffie-Helman (DH) public key $h_i = g^{s_i}$,
and each pair of clients $i,j$ can compute shared key $k_{i,j}$.
The the following is a basic protocol.

\begin{prcl}[Basic Private Data Collection]
Each client sends to the server 
\[
    y_i = x_i + \sum_{i < j} k_{i, j} - \sum_{i > j} k_{i, j},
\]
where $\sum_{i < j} k_{i, j} - \sum_{i > j} k_{i, j}$ is $mask_i$,
such that 
\[
    \sum_i mask_i = 0.
\]
This yields that 
\[
    \sum y_i = \sum x_i.
\]
\end{prcl}

\paragraph{Problem: Fragility.} If the server fails to receive a single $y_i$ value, then the entire protocol breaks down. It is very fragile!

\paragraph{Solution: Recovery Step.}
Consider this modification to the previous protocol.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Each client shares its DH secret $s_i$ with other clients using a $t$-out-of-$n$ secret sharing scheme.
\item 
The server can request shares of $s_i$ for any $y_i$ value it did not receive.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problem: Requires Semihonesty.} 
Malicious users can break privacy of users, and 
delayed messages also break privacy.

\paragraph{Solution: Individual Masks}
Users can apply individual mass via
\[
    y_i = x_i + \sum_{i < j} k_{i,j} - \sum_{i > j} k_{i,j} + r_i
\]
where users also secret share $r_i$ among the other clients.

\subsection{Prio}

\begin{prcl}[Prio]
The context is: many clients, $1 < n$servers, secure against $n-1$ semi-honest servers, each client has input $x_i$, and we want to compute $\sum x_i$.
The simple protocol is:
\putfigure{The simple version of the Prio protocol}{prio-simple}
\end{prcl}

To extend this simple protocol, 
the challenge that needs to be addressed is that we need to enforce that the clients' inputs satisfy some predicate i.e. $C(x) = 1$ for some predicate $C$.
To accomplish this, there are three options.

\subsubsection{Prio Protocol Extension 1}
The server can run an MPC protocol evaluating $C(x)$ and check if the result is $1$.

\subsubsection{Prio Protocol Extension 2}
The client can locally evaluate $C(x)$, and determine the value on every wire of the circuit. Then servers can verify correctness by secretely evaluating a $O(1)$-depth circuit.
\putfigure{Option 2 for extending the simple Prio protocol}{prio-option2}

\subsubsection{Prio Protocol Extension 3}

\paragraph{Client-side.}
The goal is to evaluate $C(x)$.
Let $M$ be the number of multiplication gates in $C$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Let $f$ be a polynomial such that $f(t) = $ the value on left input wire of gate $t$, for $1 \leq t \leq M$.
\item 
Let $g$ be a polynomial such that $g(t) = $ the value on right input wire of gate $t$, for $1 \leq t \leq M$.
\item 
Let $h = f \cdot g$ i.e. $h(t) =$ the value of output wire of gate $t$.
\item 
Provide $[x], [f(0)], [g(0)], [h]$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Server-side.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Generate $[\hat{f}]$ and $[\hat{g}]$ locally.
\begin{align*}
    f_i &= \sum_{j=0}^M f(j) \cdot \gamma_j \\
    [f_i] &= \sum_{j=0}^M [f(j)] \cdot \gamma_j \\
    h(x) &= \sum h_i x^i
    [h(x)] &= \sum x^i [h_i]
\end{align*}
\putfigure{Example of calculations for Prio extension 3 server-side}{prio-extension-3-server-side}
\end{enumerate}

The claim two-fold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a client is honest, then $\hat{f} = f, \hat{g} = g, \hat{f} \cdot \hat{g} = h$
\item If $h$ that a client shares is incorrect, then $\hat{f} \cdot \hat{g} \neq h$
\end{enumerate}
So, the servers check whether 
\[
    P(t) = t \cdot (\hat{f}(t) - \hat{g}(t) - h(t)) \equiv 0
\]
i.e. they check if $P(r) = 0$ at a random $r$.
If $P(t) \neq 0$, then
\[
    \prob_r[P(r) = 0] \leq \frac{\deg(P)}{\bF}
\]

Some more details:
\begin{itemize}
\item servers agree on $r$
\item each server locally computes $[r \cdot \hat{h}(r)], [\hat{f}(r)], [r \cdot \hat{g}(r)]$
\item each client will also share Beaver triple $[a], [b], [c], c = ab + \delta$
\item servers use Beaver triple to compute $[r \cdot \hat{f}(r) \cdot \hat{g}(r) + \delta]$
\item servers check that $[r(\hat{f}(r) \cdot \hat{g}(r) - h(r))] = [0]$ and that $t \cdot \hat{f}(t) \cdot \hat{g}(t) - h(t)) + \delta = 0$.
\end{itemize}
