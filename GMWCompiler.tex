\section{GMW Compiler}

\subsection{GMW I Compiler}

The goal is to compile any protocol with semi-honest security into a protocol with malicious security, where malicious security is security with abort.

The main idea is that parties run the semi-honest protocol $\Pi$, except that after each step each party gives a ZK proof that they correctly following the protocol. We need to ensure that parties use ``good'' randomness, and that parties use the same input/randomness throughout.

\subsubsection{Coin-tossing Protocols}

\begin{prcl}[coin-tossing]
In this protocol, one party learns a uniformly random value, and the other party gets a commitment to that value.

\end{prcl}

\begin{prcl}[GMW-I-compiled coin-tossing]
This protocol performs the same functionality as the previous coin-tossing protocol, but now with the GMW-I-compiler's assurance that neither party can behave badly.

\end{prcl}

\begin{defn}
A protocol is \textbf{secure with unanimous abort} when it is secure even when 
\begin{itemize}
\item adversarial parties learn their outputs; then abort or continue
\begin{itemize}
    \item if continue, then honest parties get output
    \item if halt, honest parties get $\bot$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

Security-with-unanimous abort is achievable for $t < n$ given broadcast.

\begin{defn}
A protocol is \textbf{secure without abort} \textit{or} \textbf{fully secure} when it is secure even when 
\begin{itemize}
\item all parties send input ot ideal functionality
\item all parties get output 
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

Security-with-abort is achievable for $t < n/2$ given broadcast.
But it is not achievable for $t \geq n/2$ (in general), even given broadcast.

The GMW I compiler, in the multi-party case, compiles a semi-honest protocol $\Pi$ into a protocol that is secure with unanimous abort.
\begin{enumerate}
\item each party commits to its input and gives a ZKPoK of its input over broadcast channel 
\item run a multi-party version of coin-tossing
\item run the semi-honest protocol and ZK proof of consistency at every step
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{GMW II Compiler}

\begin{prcl}
Given a semi-honest protocol $\Pi$, the GMW II compiler yields the following protocol:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Parties compute $\mathcal{F}_{VSS}$ using a secure-with-abort protocol, once per party. If some $P_i$ misbehaves, kick then out and use a default input in their input's place.
\item 
Parties do the same for a random version of $\mathcal{F}_{VSS}$, once per party. If some $P_i$ misbehaves, kick them out.
\item 
Run $\Pi$ using the committed inputs and randomness, giving a ZK proof of correctness after each message. If some $P_i$ fails when giving some ZK proof:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item each party broadcasts their share of $P_i$'s input/randomness, plus the corresponding $\rho$s
    \item parties reconstruct $P_i$'s input/randomness from $t+1$ correct shares
    \item parties run $\Pi$ on behalf of $P_i$ from then on
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
